            question: 'I need to reach the goal to receive my money?'
            answer: 'It depends on the type of financing you choose. In the "All or Nothing" model, you only get the money if you reach the collection goal in the campaign time stipulated by you. If the project does not meet the collection goal, we will fully refund the money to your supporters, at no cost to you or to anyone who supported you. <br><br>Already in the flexible financing mode, affectionately called "Flex", you get all the money you can get regardless of hitting the target or not.

            question: 'Where does the money from my project come from??'
            answer: 'Family, friends, fans and members of communities that you are part of are your greatest contributors. You shake this network, win support and promote the project. Supporters publicize and recommend their campaign to others they know, and so the circle of supporters grows and the campaign gets support. The key is to build a good project, plan your campaign well and know how to direct your outreach efforts to those who really care about what you are proposing in your crowdfunding campaign.'
